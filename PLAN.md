# Qwen Multi-Assistant Project Plan

## Project Overview

Qwen Multi-Assistant is an implementation of a Qwen3-based Agent-Army architecture that integrates multiple Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. The system uses specialized sub-agents to handle different tool domains, coordinated by a central router agent.

## Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Router Agent**: Central orchestrator that analyzes user intent, selects appropriate specialized agents, manages context transfer, and synthesizes responses.

2. **Specialized Agents**:
   - **Data Agent (Airtable)**: Handles database operations and data management
   - **Desktop Agent (DesktopCommander)**: Manages file system and local machine operations
   - **Search Agent (Exa)**: Performs web search and information retrieval
   - **Documentation Agent (Context7)**: Manages documentation and knowledge access

3. **Context Management System**: Maintains conversation history, tracks entities, and manages task state across agent transitions.

4. **User Interface**: Provides a chat-based interaction using Gradio with file upload capabilities and tool usage visualization.

## Implementation Phases

### MVP Phase

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.10+
- **LLM**: Qwen3 models (primarily Qwen3-235b for router, Qwen3-32b for agents)
- **UI Framework**: Gradio
- **Testing**: Pytest
- **MCP Servers**:
  - Airtable MCP Server
  - DesktopCommanderMCP
  - Exa MCP Server
  - Context7

## Development Approach
